These dashboards provide visual insights through charts and KPIs that track order volume, average delivery time, revenue, cancellations, and product demand across different locations. They typically include bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and map visuals to represent data clearly and effectively. Slicers such as date filters, city selectors, product categories, and payment methods allow users to filter and drill down into specific segments. The main goal of these dashboards is to help Blinkit’s teams make data-driven decisions to improve efficiency, reduce delays, manage inventory, and enhance customer satisfaction.
Blinkit dashboards typically use a combination of charts and slicers to monitor real-time operations, sales performance, and delivery metrics. Commonly used charts include line charts for tracking order trends over time, bar and column charts for comparing city-wise sales or delivery performance, and pie or donut charts for visualizing the distribution of payment methods or product categories. Map charts help display geographic performance across cities or zones, while KPI cards highlight key metrics like total orders, average delivery time, and revenue. Slicers or filters such as date range, city or location, product category, payment method, and delivery status allow users to interactively explore and segment the data for deeper insights. These visuals help Blinkit make quick, data-driven decisions to improve speed, efficiency, and customer satisfaction.
